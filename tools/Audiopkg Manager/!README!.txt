Step 1: place AUDIOPKG files into this folder
Step 2: run one of the !EXTRACT! files depending on what version it is
Step 3: edit the sound files (mp3, wav, or aiff files only)
Step 4a: Make sure you have python 3.12.5 (lower might work, but I'm using this one)

Step 4c: install ffmpeg using "winget install ffmpeg"
Step 4d: run the !AUDIOSCRIPTS! file
Step 5: run the !PACKAGE! file
