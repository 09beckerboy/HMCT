Hobbit Mod Creation Tool (HMCT) v2.0 by 09beckerboy
-------------------------------------------------------------

Credit to Modera for the xbmp converter, unpack dfs, and dfs packer.

To use, just run hmct.py or hmct-gui.py.

After exporting a mod, you can either zip the folder in exported mods, or move the contents to The Hobbit directory.

It's strongly advised that you make a backup of the default files before you make any mods.
You can do this with the tool itself, by adding all levels, then not editing anything.
