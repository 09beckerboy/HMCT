VI. Troubleshooting

1. If your game does not start, your video card may not be supported. Please check your video card against the list of supported video cards.

THE HOBBIT(TM) has been tested on most, but not all of the major video cards incorporating the chipsets below:

NVIDIA
  GeForce 256 Series
  GeForce 2 Series
  GeForce 3 Series
  GeForce 4 Series
  GeForce FX Series

ATI
  Radeon 7200
  Radeon 7500
  Radeon 8500
  Radeon 9000 (9000 Pro)
  Radeon 9500 (9500 Pro)
  Radeon 9600 (9600 Pro)
  Radeon 9700 (9700 Pro)
  Radeon 9800 (9800 Pro)

MATROX
  Parhelia 512

SIS
  Xabre 400 

The following graphics card chipsets are not supported by THE HOBBIT(TM), or exhibit known problems:
Any Video Card that does not support Transform and Lighting.

If you are experiencing difficulties with your video card, please try upgrading to the latest drivers available for your card. We’ve included some video card website information for your convenience.

NVidia
http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp

ATI
http://mirror.ati.com/support/driver.html

Matrox
http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/home.cfm

2.  Do not connect or disconnect a USB device while this program is running.

3.  If THE HOBBIT(TM) crashes after you increase your video resolution, your video card may not support that resolution at your monitor’s current refresh rate. Under Windows® 2000/XP, THE HOBBIT(TM) should be able to detect this situation and will attempt to warn you. However, under Windows® 98/ME, THE HOBBIT(TM) is unable to determine your monitor’s current refresh rate. Lower your monitor’s refresh rate, and try again.

4.  If you hear bursts of static, you likely have the DirectX® developer SDK installed and you are using the Debug version. You can remove the bursts of static by selecting the Retail version of DirectX®:

* Click the Start Menu
* Click Programs - Microsoft DirectX® SDK - Install DirectX® RunTime - Install Retail DirectX®

5. Any Sound Card that does not support DirectX 8.1 or above is not supported by THE HOBBIT(TM).

6. If you have 2 CD-ROM drives and are attempting to run the game with the CD in the second CD-ROM drive, but it will not start from the Autoplay application, please start the game from the Start Menu shortcut.

7. If you are running Windows® 2000 or XP, and do not have Administrator privileges, you will need to have your system administrator install/uninstall the game for you. You also will not be able to save games.

8. If you are running Windows® under 16bit color depth, you will need to switch to 32bit color before starting The Hobbit(TM).  The Hobbit(TM) will only run in 32bit color mode.

9. For best performance it is recommended that systems and video cards closer to minimum system specification utilize the default system resolution.  Utilizing a higher resolution could dramatically impact game performance.

10. If you are experiencing a lot of latency it is recommended that you try switching your systems Direct 3D® Settings to "Best Performance" instead of "Best Quality."

11. If your video display settings are set to a resolution which is not supported by your hardware or monitor, you should start the game in "Safe Mode".  Begin the game in "Safe Mode" by clicking on the Start Menu shortcut "The Hobbit(TM) (Safe Mode)".  


VII. Manual Corrections 

* Page 27, Performance Options: The Hobbit(TM) supports three additional performance options which are not listed in the manual.  These options can be changed by adjusting the slider bars.  The additional performance options are:

Clip Plane - Adjusts your viewable distance
Texture Quality - Adjusts the resolution of textures
Lighting Quality - Adjusts the number of dynamic lighting elements and effects.
