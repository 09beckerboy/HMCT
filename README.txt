Hobbit Texture Pack Creation Tool (HTPCT) v1.2 by 09beckerboy
-------------------------------------------------------------

Credit to Modera for the xbmp converter, unpack dfs, and dfs packer.

To use, just run htpct.py.

After exporting a pack, you can either zip the folder in exported packs, or move the contents to The Hobbit directory.

It's strongly advised that you make a backup of the default textures before you make any packs.
You can do this with the tool itself, by adding all levels, then not editing anything.

Message me with any suggestions, @09beckerboy on Discord.

GUI version coming eventually, when I learn how to do GUIs.
